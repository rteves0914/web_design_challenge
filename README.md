# web_design_challenge
Use HTML to create a website:

In this project, I use previously created data to display on an interactive website. Using my project titled "Python_API_challenge" I pull in the visualizations and data frame from that project. Each visualization is clickable and takes you to a new web page. All of this is done using HTML along with the aide of CSS and Bootstrap.
